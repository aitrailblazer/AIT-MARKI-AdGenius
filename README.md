### Inspiration
AIT-MARKI-AdGenius was conceived to harness the transformative power of AI in social media advertising and integrate it with the innovative functionalities of Chainlink. Recognizing the challenge of capturing attention on Tik Tok, we envisioned a solution that not only creates personalized, engaging content but also leverages blockchain technology for enhanced features and transparency.

### Chainlink Integration for State Changes
A key aspect of AIT-MARKI-AdGenius is its integration with Chainlink to effectuate state changes on the blockchain, a core requirement for the Chainlink Hackathon. We utilized Chainlink Data Feeds and Streams for real-time data, influencing ad content with current trends and market data. Chainlink VRF ensures fairness in ad placement, and Chainlink Automation manages ad postings on the blockchain.

### Blockchain Interaction
Our smart contract design interacts with the TikTok Shop platform, automating ad posting, tracking, and performance analysis. These smart contracts, influenced by Chainlink integrations, fulfill the hackathon's criteria of state change on the blockchain, adding a layer of innovation and functionality to the advertising process.

### Revenue Model and Monetization
We explored various revenue models, including subscription fees and pay-per-ad systems, integrated with blockchain for transparent and automated transactions. This approach aims to monetize the platform while providing value to users.

### User Interface and Experience
The user interface of AIT-MARKI-AdGenius is designed to be intuitive, allowing advertisers to create, customize, and track ads with ease. AI-generated recommendations for ad optimization are powered by analytics from Chainlink Data Feeds, enhancing the effectiveness of each ad.

### Testing and Optimization
Functionality and reliability are key, so we rigorously tested AIT-MARKI-AdGenius across devices and within the TikTok environment. Special attention was given to ensuring smooth operation of Chainlink integrations under various scenarios.

### Compliance and Ethical Considerations
Adherence to advertising standards and TikTokâ€™s policies was paramount. We also addressed ethical concerns related to AI-generated content and data privacy, ensuring that AIT-MARKI-AdGenius is not only innovative but also responsible.

### Documentation and Presentation
Comprehensive documentation details the use of Chainlink services and AI integration. Our presentation highlights the app's innovation, Chainlink integration, and market potential, aligning AIT-MARKI-AdGenius with the Chainlink Hackathon's focus on blockchain-state changes and revenue generation.
